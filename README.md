# Vehicle-Detection-System

Hi guys, This repository consist of a source code of script to detect cars in a video/camera frame and then draw rectangaluar boxes around them.

The ML algorithms used for detecting cars and bounding boxes coordinates is a pretrained cascade model Haarcascade car

Getting started
Firstly we have to clone the project repository or download the zip of project and then extract it.

git 
cd Vehicle Dection Python
Vehicle Dection Python ->
Dependencies
Now once we have the project repo in our local directory, now lets install the dependecies required to run our script

pip install opencv-python
Sample video
The sample video we used in this project is [cars.mp4] which will come as you download or clone the repository, to load a different video with different filename, you might wanna change the source code a bit.

def Simulator():
    CarVideo = cv2.VideoCapture('cars.mp4') # change cars.mp4 to name of your vidoe
    while CarVideo.isOpened():
        ret, frame = CarVideo.read()
        controlkey = cv2.waitKey(1)
        if ret:        
            cars_frame = detect_cars(frame)
            cv2.imshow('frame', cars_frame)
        else:
            break
        if controlkey == ord('q'):
            break

    CarVideo.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
